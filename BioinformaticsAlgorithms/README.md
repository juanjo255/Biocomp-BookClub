# Bioinformatics Algorithms

* I'm following the book Bioinformatics Algortihms, here you will find the exercises solved in Python (from other source, see below) and in Rust.
* The repository ***bioinformatics*** contains solutions by other user, it's very ordered and it can be useful to show to newcomers of the computational biology hotbed.
